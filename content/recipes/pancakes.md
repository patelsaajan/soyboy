A Story Behind the Dish
::

::para
I was staying with a mate, and it was Pancake Day, so I thought—**why not make some pancakes?** That’s pretty much it for this one! 😆  

Also, I needed some **pancake practice for Wednesday, February 28th, 2024!** 😉

Quick Facts
::

::para
- **Light, fluffy, and 100% vegan!**  
- **No eggs needed** – apple cider vinegar does the magic. ✨  
- **Customize with mix-ins** like seeds, chocolate chips, or fruit!  
::

## Method  

::para
**Step 1: Prep Any Seeds (If Using)**  

If you're adding **chia or flax seeds**, stir them into a little water in a small bowl and let them sit while you prep the batter. 🌱  
::

::para
**Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients**  

In a large mixing bowl, combine the **flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt**. Give it a good stir to evenly distribute everything. 🥣  
::

::para
**Step 3: Mix Wet Ingredients**  

In another bowl, whisk together the **soya milk, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla extract**. Let this sit for **2–3 minutes**—it will slightly curdle, acting as a buttermilk substitute.  
::

::para
**Step 4: Combine Wet & Dry**  

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and **gently mix** until just combined. Let the batter rest for **5 minutes** to help the baking powder activate. If you prepared seeds earlier, mix them in now!  
::

::para
**Step 5: Cook the Pancakes**  

Heat a frying pan over **medium-high heat**. Once hot, **lower the heat to medium** and lightly grease the pan.  

Pour **small amounts of batter** into the pan. Flip once the edges start lifting and bubbles form on the surface. Cook the other side for **another minute or so** until golden brown. 🍳
