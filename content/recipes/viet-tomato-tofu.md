# Method

::para
**Step 1: Prepare the Tofu**

Take the tofu out of the packaging and press it for about 15-20 minutes to remove excess moisture. Then, cut it into bite-sized cubes or rectangles.
::

::para
**Step 2: Fry the Tofu**

Heat oil in a pan over medium heat, ensuring there's enough to coat the bottom. Fry the tofu pieces until they turn golden brown and crispy. Work in batches if needed, then transfer the tofu to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.
::

::para
**Step 3: Make the Tomato Sauce**

Using the same pan, remove most of the excess oil, leaving about 2 tablespoons. Saut√© the sliced onion until translucent, then add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant. Stir in the diced tomatoes and let them cook down until they form a sauce-like consistency.
::

::para
**Step 4: Season the Sauce**

Add soy sauce (or vegan fish sauce), a pinch of sugar, salt, and black pepper. Stir everything together and let it cook for a few minutes, adjusting the seasoning to taste.
::

::para
**Step 5: Combine the Tofu and Sauce**

Return the fried tofu to the pan and gently stir to coat each piece with the sauce. Add a splash of water, mix well, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes so the tofu absorbs the flavors.
::

::para
**Step 6: Garnish and Serve**

Sprinkle with chopped green onions and fresh cilantro if using. Serve hot with steamed rice and enjoy!
