Method
::

::para
**Step 1: Prepare the Tofu**  
Choose your tofu prep style: either drain and pat dry, then coat in cornflour and salt for frying, or use the quicker method â€” simmer in salted water for 10 minutes to firm it up with minimal effort.

::

::para
**Step 2: Chop & SautÃ© the Aromatics**  
Dice the onion and fry it in a pan over medium heat with a pinch of salt for 5â€“7 minutes until soft and translucent. Meanwhile, mince the garlic, chop the ginger (into fine matchsticks or mince), and dice the chillies. Add them all to the pan and cook until fragrant.

::

::para
**Step 3: Add the Dry Spices**  
Stir in the paprika, cayenne pepper, and parsley along with a splash of water to stop burning. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

::

::para
**Step 4: Add the Coconut & Lime**  
Pour in the coconut cream and stir well. Squeeze in the lime juice and let everything simmer gently. For a thicker sauce, stir in a cornstarch slurry (1 tsp cornflour + 1 tbsp water).

::

::para
**Step 5: Finish & Serve**  
Add chopped coriander and optional greens such as edamame, sugar snap peas, or green beans. Serve hot with rice and enjoy a punchy, creamy, protein-rich bowl of goodness.
