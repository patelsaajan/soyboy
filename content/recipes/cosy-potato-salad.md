Quick Facts
::

::para
- **Potatoes are complex carb champs ðŸ¥”** â€“ slow-digesting starch helps keep blood sugar stable and energy sustained.  
- **Avocados deliver healthy fats ðŸ¥‘** â€“ rich in oleic acid, which supports heart health and helps absorb fat-soluble vitamins.  
- **Beans + corn = complete protein ðŸŒ½ðŸ«˜** â€“ together they provide all essential amino acids for a balanced, plant-powered boost.

# Method
::

::para
**Step 1: Roast the Potatoes**  
Preheat your oven to 200Â°C (fan). Scrub the baking potatoes clean, then rub them with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Place them straight onto the oven rack or a tray and bake for around 45 minutes â€” until theyâ€™re crisp on the outside and soft all the way through.  
::

::para
**Step 2: Prep the Mix**  
While the potatoes are baking, finely dice the onion, avocado, garlic, and plum tomatoes. Add them to a large mixing bowl along with the drained beans and sweetcorn. Roughly chop the dill and toss that in too.  
::

::para
**Step 3: Dress It Up**  
To the bowl, add your mayo (if you can make some homemade mayo), a drizzle of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir gently to combine, keeping some texture.  
::

::para
**Step 4: Scoop the Potato**  
Once the baked potatoes have cooled slightly, cut them in half and scoop out the fluffy insides into the salad mix. Fold everything together so it becomes creamy but still chunky. Keep the empty skins to the side â€” donâ€™t toss them!  
::

::para
**Step 5: Serve & Garnish**  
Just before serving, reheat the potato skins in the oven until hot and crisp. Spoon the potato salad mixture back into the skins for a cosy presentation. Top with a drizzle of sriracha mayo and a sprinkle of sliced spring onions.

Enjoy warm or chilled, solo or as a side. This one brings comfort and crunch together perfectly. ðŸ¥”ðŸŒ¿
