A Story Behind the Dish
::

::para
If you ever find yourself growing tired of the same old baked beans and are craving something a bit more exciting, then this recipe is just the thing for you.  

I initially started making this with my flatmate as a way to add some pizzazz to plain canned beans. But honestly, you can **ditch the sugary baked beans** and opt for **tinned tomatoes** with your favorite bean variety instead.  

The dish featured in the photo was made on my **last day visiting my friend Tatsuki in Pembrokeshire**. We ate in the garden with his dad, watching baby chicks scurry around in the summer sun. **It was the perfect setting for a meal like this.** ☀️🐣

## Method  

::para
**Step 1: Prep Your Ingredients**  

Start by slicing the **onion** into a shape that sparks joy. (I prefer mine finely diced so they melt into the sauce, but if you like strips, go for it!). Mince the **garlic** and slice the **chilis**. 🌶️

**Step 2: Sauté the Aromatics**  

Heat some oil in a saucepan over **medium-high heat**. I usually use vegetable oil since olive oil can overpower the flavors (or so I've been told!).  

Once hot, fry the **onions** until they start turning golden. Add the **garlic and chilis**, then lower the heat slightly. Cook for **2-3 minutes** until fragrant. 🧄🔥

**Step 3: Spice it Up**  

Now, **add your favorite dry spices**—I love **oregano, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper**, but feel free to get creative! Toast them for a minute before pouring in the **tinned tomatoes**.  

Add a mug of water, then **let it reduce for 5 minutes** on medium heat. 🍅

**Step 4: Beans & Simmer**  

Stir in your **beans** and another splash of water. Let them **simmer for about 10 minutes**, soaking up all those flavors. **Adjust consistency** with water as needed.  

Right before serving, squeeze in **some lemon juice** and drizzle with **olive oil**. If you're feeling bold, add a dash of **Tabasco** for extra kick! 🌶️🍋
