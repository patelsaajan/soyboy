A Story Behind the Dish
::

::para
This isn’t the kind of meal you’d make for a **date night**—at least not for one of those **early dates**. But it’s **quick, easy, and absolutely bangs**.  

For real, I made this dish when my **university flat was completely empty**, and I couldn’t even be bothered to walk **three minutes to the shops**. That’s how good and **low-effort** this meal is.  

If you want **a full garlic overload**, I’d recommend making some **homemade garlic bread** to go with it. 🧄🔥

If using **sun-dried tomatoes**, add them halfway through this step.

Meanwhile, bring a **large pot of salted water** to a boil. If you’re feeling like a grown-up, go for **whole wheat pasta**. 😉  

Once boiling, add **375g of pasta** and cook according to package instructions—usually **around 10 minutes**.  

Before draining, **save a cup of pasta water** to help make the sauce.
