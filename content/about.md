Hi, I'm Saajan,
::

::para
I created this space to share my love for cooking and to store all the recipes I’ve picked up along the way. Like many, I often forget to write down my creations, so this website is where I can keep them all in one place—and share them with others. Plus, friends and family are always asking for my recipes, so I thought, “Why not make them easy to find?”
::

::para
While I don’t stick to any one type of cuisine, I have a special place in my heart for *spicy* and *nutty* flavours. And **rice**? Well, *you can never have too much rice*, in my opinion. It’s a staple that brings comfort and versatility to so many dishes.

::para
I’ve been vegetarian my whole life but made the transition to veganism in **2020**. It wasn’t a quick process—it took me about a year to figure out how to do it right, and I know that’s a struggle many people face. I’m here to help others who are curious about making the switch. The learning curve is real, but I want to show you how easy and delicious it can be. And if you’re worried about giving up flavour, don’t—*vegan food can be just as rich and satisfying as anything else!*
::

::para
There’s also a stigma around veganism that I’m determined to break. Too often, people think vegans are *weak* or *small*, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I want to lead by example and show that vegan living is about *strength*, *health*, and *energy*.
::

::para
Another goal of mine is to try a wide range of cuisines and *veganise* them. Becoming vegan doesn’t mean losing your culture or the foods you love—it’s all about adapting and moving forward, finding new ways to enjoy the flavours that are meaningful to you.
::

::para
For me, cooking is more than just making a meal—it’s a *therapeutic experience*. In a world where instant food and takeaways are so common, I truly believe there’s something special about preparing food from scratch and sharing it with others. My *mum* and *grandmother* always showed their love through cooking, and I’ve inherited that same passion.
::

::para
I hope that when you visit my website, you’ll take away not just recipes, but inspiration. My mission is to make cooking knowledge **free** and **accessible** to everyone because I believe it has the power to nourish the *soul*, *body*, and *mind*. Plus, it can make a real difference to the environment and the ethical choices we make about what goes into our bodies.
