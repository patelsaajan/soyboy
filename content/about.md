Welcome!
::

::para
I’m **Saajan**, and I created this space to share my love for cooking and to store all the recipes I’ve picked up along the way. Like many, I often forget to write down my creations, so this website is where I can keep them all in one place—and share them with others. Plus, friends and family are always asking for my recipes, so I thought, “Why not make them easy to find?”
::

::para
While I don’t stick to any one type of cuisine, I have a special place in my heart for _spicy_ and _nutty_ flavours. And **rice**? Well, _you can never have too much rice_, in my opinion. It’s a staple that brings comfort and versatility to so many dishes.

I’ve been vegetarian my whole life but made the transition to veganism in **2020**. It wasn’t a quick process—it took me about a year to figure out how to do it right, and I know that’s a struggle many people face. I’m here to help others who are curious about making the switch. The learning curve is real, but I want to show you how easy and delicious it can be. And if you’re worried about giving up flavour, don’t—_vegan food can be just as rich and satisfying as anything else!_
::

::para
There’s also a stigma around veganism that I’m determined to break. Too often, people think vegans are _weak_ or _small_, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I want to lead by example and show that vegan living is about _strength_, _health_, and _energy_.
::

::para
Another goal of mine is to try a wide range of cuisines and _veganise_ them. Becoming vegan doesn’t mean losing your culture or the foods you love—it’s all about adapting and moving forward, finding new ways to enjoy the flavours that are meaningful to you.
::

::para
For me, cooking is more than just making a meal—it’s a _therapeutic experience_. In a world where instant food and takeaways are so common, I truly believe there’s something special about preparing food from scratch and sharing it with others. My _mum_ and _grandmother_ always showed their love through cooking, and I’ve inherited that same passion.
::

::para
I hope that when you visit my website, you’ll take away not just recipes, but inspiration. My mission is to make cooking knowledge **free** and **accessible** to everyone because I believe it has the power to nourish the _soul_, _body_, and _mind_. Plus, it can make a real difference to the environment and the ethical choices we make about what goes into our bodies.
